Ca²⁺ Manager
============

The Ca²⁺ Manager is a [Image J][ImageJ] plugin to generate Kymographs
for calcium image recordings of neurons. The plugins allows the grouping
of recordings multiple cells for a single animal. These can be exported
together with simple metadata information, like the animal age, in a
[NIX][nixio] file. The latter can be viewed via the [NixView][nixview]
program. Further processing of the data, e.g. averages across all
Kymographs, can be done via the [CaAnalysis][analysis] scripts.
